# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
# For this project, we will be using the popular MNIST database. It is a collection of 70000 handwritten digits split into training and test set of 60000 and 10000 images respectively.
# PyTorch provides an easy implementation to download the cleaned and already prepared data.
# I have learnt how to work with image data and we have a baseline for our neural network, we want you to try to achieve a good accuracy by training a model for different hyperparameters.
